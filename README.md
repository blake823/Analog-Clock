Color Sense Example as a Designer


Well many designers these days learn how to design. but forgot to learn a common thing in design, and i.e, Colour Sense. 
Color Sense is an important skill in Designing. 
This analog clock shows how to match colours that blend together and seprates each other to the extent that user can tell, by one look, which color is background and which color is foreground.
